_Note: I have a windows laptop and I was lucky the theme was easy to set up._
The first step for my internship was setting up a static website, a place where I could store all my documentation.

### What you are gonna need

- [**Github desktop**](https://desktop.github.com)
- [**RubyInstaller**](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### The proces

Before we start make sure you have all of these programs downloaded.

- github desktop
- rubyinstaller
- git
- visual code studio

#### Setting up github.

First we need to set up a github repository, you do this by going to the [**github website**](https://github.com) here we are going to make a new repository by clicking the `new` button.

- As name put your website name.
- In the description we write what were gonna use the website for.
- Put it on `public`.
- Add a read.me file
- For .gitignore we are gonna choose to use `jekyll`.
- For the license we are gonna use `MIT`.

#### Open Github desktop.

Click on `clone repository` and look for the one you just created.
